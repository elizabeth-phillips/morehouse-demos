# CSS Frameworks


## What is Front End Framework?

Until now, vanilla CSS has been used to style websites, positioning elements can become difficult and tedious very quickly.

Thankfully, other developers have experienced the same pains, and decided to craft solutions that address the issues we've been facing. Those solutions come in the form of front-end frameworks like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Zurb Foundations](http://foundation.zurb.com/), and [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/)

While these frameworks all work in similar fashion, we will be focusing on bootstrap. This is for 2 major reasons.

1. Bootstrap is the second most starred project on GitHub.
2. The bootstrap documentation has clear code samples and explanations make learning how to use bootstrap simple and straightforward.

## History

Bootstrap was created by Twitter employees to encourage consistency among internal tools. As the project began to grow, team members realized that many developers would benefit from this new tool, and the project was released into the open source world.

## What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap is a css framework. When you install Bootstrap into a project, you gain access to stylesheets with pre-defined classes. By adding those classes to html elements, you will get default styling for forms, buttons, navbars, etc. You also get access to Bootstrap's grid system and jquery extensions.

The Front End frameworks mentioned above are used on most web applications and websites today. Examples of sites that use bootstrap can be found at the [The Bootstrap Expo](http://expo.getbootstrap.com/).
